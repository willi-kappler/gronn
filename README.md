# GRONN
**GRO**wing **N**eural **N**etwork

Gronn allows you to use new data with pre-trained networks. Gronn adapts the network to the problem using an evolutionary algorithm:

- The number of nodes can change
- The number of connections between nodes can change
- Connections are arbitrary, so cycles are possible

Gronn is still work in progress and a prove of concept.
